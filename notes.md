Yes, there are several forms and modes of operation for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a symmetric encryption algorithm established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a replacement for DES. AES is widely used across the globe for its strong security features and efficiency. Besides the standard AES encryption, there are various modes of operation that determine how the encryption is applied to data blocks, especially useful for encrypting large amounts of data or ensuring data integrity. Here are some of the notable modes of operation for AES:

### 1. ECB (Electronic Codebook)

ECB mode encrypts each block of data independently. While it's simple and fast, it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality since identical blocks of plaintext will encrypt to identical blocks of ciphertext, potentially revealing patterns in the data.

### 2. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)

CBC mode addresses the issue of pattern visibility by XORing each block of plaintext with the previous ciphertext block before encryption. This ensures that identical blocks of plaintext will result in different blocks of ciphertext, enhancing security.

### 3. CFB (Cipher Feedback)

CFB mode uses a feedback mechanism based on the cipher's state to generate keystream blocks, which are then XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext. It can operate in both stream and block modes.

### 4. OFB (Output Feedback)

OFB mode generates a pseudorandom stream of bits that is XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext. It avoids the potential vulnerability to replay attacks present in CFB mode by not using the ciphertext as part of the feedback mechanism.

### 5. CTR (Counter)

CTR mode combines a counter with the encryption algorithm to generate a keystream, which is then XORed with the plaintext. It offers the advantage of parallelism and easy handling of variable-length messages.

### 6. GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)

GCM is a mode that provides both authentication and confidentiality. It uses a counter-based construction and incorporates a MAC (Message Authentication Code) to detect tampering. GCM is widely used for its efficiency and performance in securing data.

### 7. CCMP (CCM Mode Plus Padding)

CCMP is essentially CCM mode with added support for padding, making it suitable for protocols that require a fixed-length ciphertext.

### 8. EAX (Extended Authenticated Encryption)

EAX mode provides both authenticated encryption and optional public-key verification. It separates the encryption and authentication processes, offering flexibility and efficiency.

### 9. SIV (Synthetic Initialization Vector)

SIV mode is designed for applications where the initialization vector (IV) needs to be publicly verifiable, ensuring that all parties agree on the IV used for encryption.

These modes offer various trade-offs in terms of security, performance, and functionality. The choice of mode depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for authentication, the size of the data being encrypted, and the desired level of security.

```
async function encryptWithAESGCM(plaintext, key) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(plaintext);
  const iv = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12)); // IV must be unique and unpredictable

  const encryptedData = await window.crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    {
      name: "AES-GCM",
      iv: iv,
    },
    key,
    data
  );

  return { ciphertext: encryptedData, iv: iv };
}
```
